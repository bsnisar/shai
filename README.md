## Intro

Are you a person who had trouble remembering shell commands and flags for all shell commands? This is yet another helper that 
can make the shell more human-friendly. Just say what to do, not remember. 

## Build 

Create a standalone executable binary by running:
```
pyinstaller --onefile my_cli_app
```

This command will create a dist directory containing the standalone binary. You can distribute this binary to others, and they can run your CLI app without needing to install Python or any dependencies.
